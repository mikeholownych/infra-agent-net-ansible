- `vault_argocd_password`: Vaulted ArgoCD password for CLI login.
- `git_repo_url`: HTTPS URL of this Git repository (e.g., `https://github.com/org/repo.git`).

## Tasks
1. **Install ArgoCD CLI**: Downloads and installs the ArgoCD binary.
2. **Login to ArgoCD**: Authenticates via CLI using vaulted credentials.
3. **Create ArgoCD Application**: Defines the application pointing to this repoâ€™s `main` branch and configures automated sync with self-heal policy.
4. **Sync Application**: Performs an initial sync to apply the current desired state.

## Usage
Invoke this role after provisioning and deploying core infrastructure to set up continuous deployment via ArgoCD. Ensure that the Kubernetes context is configured and ArgoCD server is reachable.
